               Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls<br>
               Trying to hold back through my draws<br>
               Steps upstage didn't think I saw<br>

               I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase<br>
               No time to waste back to my place<br>
               Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away<br>
               Or more like a palace, shall I say<br>
               Plus I got pal if your gal is game<br>
               In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing<br>
               "Akon!"<br>
